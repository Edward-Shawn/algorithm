922. Sort Array By Parity II

Given an array A of non-negative integers, half of the integers in A are odd, and half of the integers are even.  

Sort the array so that whenever A[i] is odd, i is odd; and whenever A[i] is even, i is even.  

You may return any answer array that satisfies this condition.
